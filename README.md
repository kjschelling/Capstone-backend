Welcome to my Cosemetic Ingredient Site.

This site allows the user to log in, add an ingredient they're interested in collection info about
It allows users to have a place they can store revelent links & notes about a particular ingredient. 

This site was created to aid me in my dream of developing my own skincare line.  It gave me
a place to add ingredients I'm interested in and it's resources in one organized space.

=== Development Process ===

User Stories:

-User should sign up, sign in, change password and sign out
-user should be able to view, create and delete an ingredient
-user should be able to view create, update and delete ingredients additional info


Technologies used:
-Rails
-Ember.js
-Heroku
-CSS and Sass
-HTML

Dependencies:
bundle install

Things I was improve:
-add a search bar
-better styling
-favorites resource

Planning:

-First, map out ERD and user stories

- set up both backend and frontend and deployed both

- start working the api getting first resource created and functioning.
 Move to frontend & set up the resource and getting it to show and create.

-  create second resource in the backend then move to the frontend to finish
all the CRUD functions for all resources.

- add finishing touches.
